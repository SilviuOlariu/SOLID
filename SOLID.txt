SOLID

SRP
    - the class should have just one single reason the be changed
    - your class should do many things but just one 
	
OCP
    - your class should be open for extension but close for modification one it's on production
	- if you are in the development process this doesn't apply 
	- don't modify code that already works except it is a bug
	- you might introduce potential bugs
	- not tie yourself directly to classes
	- extract interfaces even for model
    - you can achive OCP through interfacesm base clases, extensions
	
DIP
   - High level modules shouldn't depend on low level modules but rather depend on Abstractions( interfaces)
